1. Which are valid?
  a.Not a valid declaration. Two different types must be separated by semicolon.
  b.valid field
  c.valid declaration of local variable
  d.valid local variables
  e.valid field
  f.valid field
2. Mark True or False
  a.False, variables of the same or different types can be declared on the same long as long as proper syntax is used.
  b.False, scope is extent of use/visibility.
  c.false, can be used.
  d.True
  e.False, compiler assume that the code is correct and the name is of local variable where the variable is originally defined.
3. Using symbolic constants simplifies program maintenance because changing the value in only one place where it is declared will stem throughout after recompiling which is must faster than having to change every literal value that was inserted if using literal constants.
4. B
5. compiled
6. Output
  a.0
  b.0
  c.5.0
  d.5.0
  e.3
7. Below
  a.105
  b.19.0
8. count += ((total/pages)-5)* words - 1 
9. System.out.println(.5*(g*t*t));
10. There is already a method for this. Math.round()
