**From the AP:**
>  Computer science embraces problem solving, hardware, algorithms, and perspectives
that help people utilize computers to address real-world problems in contemporary life.
As the study of computer science is evolving, the careful design of the AP Computer
Science A course and exam continues to strive to engage a diverse student population,
including female and underrepresented students, with the rigorous and rewarding
concepts of computer science. Students who take the AP Computer Science A course
and exam are well prepared to continue their study of computer science and its
integration into a wide array of computing and STEM-related fields.
The AP Computer Science A curriculum provides resources, such as applicationrelated
labs, that connect with students with diverse interests, particularly female and
underrepresented student populations. The course is engaging and underscores the
importance of communicating solutions appropriately and in ways that are relevant to
current societal needs. Thus, a well-designed, modern AP Computer Science A course
can help address traditional issues of equity, access, and broadening participation in
computing while providing a strong and engaging introduction to fundamental areas
of the discipline.

>  The AP Computer Science A course introduces students to computer science with
fundamental topics that include problem solving, design strategies and methodologies,
organization of data (data structures), approaches to processing data (algorithms),
analysis of potential solutions, and the ethical and social implications of computing.
The course emphasizes both object-oriented and imperative problem solving and
design. These techniques represent proven approaches for developing solutions that
can scale up from small, simple problems to large, complex problems. For a listing of
the topics addressed, see the Computer Science A topic outline on pages 8â€“10.
The AP Computer Science A course curriculum is compatible with many CS1
courses in colleges and universities. Some colleges and universities may organize their
curricula in alternative ways, so that the topics of the AP Computer Science A course
are spread over several college courses, with other topics from computer science
interspersed.

>  The AP Computer Science A course is compatible with recommendations of the
Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the Computer Society of the
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE-CS) in several fundamental
areas. ACM/IEEE-CS Knowledge Units represented in the AP Computer Science A
course include fundamental data structures and algorithms, machine-level
representation of data, object-oriented programming, basic type systems, algorithms
and design, fundamental programming concepts, fundamental data structures,
development methods, and social context. The AP Computer Science A course is
compatible with the curriculum outlined in the Topics in Computer Science course of
the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA).

>  The AP Computer Science A course can be offered by any secondary school that
has faculty who possess the necessary expertise and have access to appropriate
computing facilities. The course represents college-level achievement for which many
colleges and universities grant advanced placement and credit. Placement and credit
are granted by institutions in accordance with their own policies, not by the College
Board or the AP Program.

**From me:**

I have started this repo because of the numerous issues that I take up with the AP. The primary being that this is largely a course that favors recall and the ability to edit snippets rather than having true knowledge of Java. With that being said I have decided to commit all of our classwork, homework and projects here. The class currently being taught at WHS is based on "Java Methods Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures, Second AP Edition- with GridWorld". With that in mind, all of the answers posted here correspond to excercise sets provided by the book.

I have broken this repo down into three categories: projects, labs and homework. Any pertinent material covered in the class can be found here. I commit my answers and work in the hope that I create a good resource for those in the future to use and so that students will have a wholesome place to turn to when they are in need of answers/explanations rather than blatantly cheating. 

  Furthermore, to note, at times I do get very sassy. I bring this humor/attitude to this repo because it relates to my frustration with the material and way the class is taught. Often this sass is a jab at the AP and therefore I am using this repo as my means for trying to better the course.
